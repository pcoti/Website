				<h3>C.V.</h3>
				<p>Two things to note: first, this is at best, semi-formal. Expect occasional stabs at humour. Second, if you're reading this because you found me on LinkedIn or something, and you're a recruiting manager, and you're considering inviting me to interview for a job, please <a href = "http://blog.ironholds.org/dear-recruiters/">go read this first</a>. It'll potentially save both of us some time. </p>

				<h4> Interests</h4>
				<p> At the moment, my primary interests as a researcher are centred around differences: differences in ways of consuming content, differences in cultures, and differences in geographic location.</p>

				<p>Although I do and have done work around the contributor base of Wikipedia, what fascinates me is our readers: the vast, silent horde of people who become donors and editors and even staffers, and how well we're serving our goal of bringing them the sum of all human knowledge.</p>

				<h4> Work </h4>

				<h5 style = "text-align: center"> Research) Analyst - Wikimedia Foundation</h5>
				<h6 style = "text-align: center"> December 2013 - Present</h6>
				<br/>
				<p>I'm currently employed as a Research Analyst at the Wikimedia Foundation, and have been since December 2013.</p>

				<p>My work primarily involves traffic analysis, along with various <em>ad hoc</em> editing-related requests, and personal projects that database access lets me work on. Highlights for me so far have been:</p>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>
				  		<p>Defining content consumption metrics for a top-10 website with a decade of technical debt and accretion, including the new definition and filter set for "<a href = "https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view">pageviews</a>". This is being done in collaboration with <a href = "http://quelltextlich.at/">Christian Aistleitner</a> and <a href = "">Erik Zachte</a> and involves handling a large number of different access methods, with accompanying sensitivity analysis, in a way transparent and understandable to the lay reader.</p>

							<p>As part of the definition task, I implemented <a href = "https://github.com/Ironholds/pageviews">a prototype</a> in R that processed approximately 500 days of sampled request logs in less than 10 days of runtime.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
				  		<p>Pioneering the use of the Hive and Hadoop stack within the Research & Data team. When I joined the team, the stack was in alpha and not actively used by researchers; we're now preparing to use it for production systems.</p>

				  		<p>My role in setting up the system consisted of extensive alpha-testing and debugging, and training other researchers in the use of Hive as a query platform.</p>
					</li>
				 	<li>
				  		<p>Collaborations with external researchers, including <a href = "http://www.scotthale.net/blog/">Scott Hale</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Ford">Heather Ford</a> and <a href = "http://www.macalester.edu/academics/mscs/facultystaff/shiladsen/">Shilad Sen</a> on various projects involving the geographic distribution of both reading and editing, and variations between countries or areas. See "research" for more details.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h5 style = "text-align: center">Community Liaison, Product Development - Wikimedia Foundation</h5>
				<h6 style = "text-align: center">November 2011 - December 2013</h6>
				<br/>
				<p>Prior to my research work, I handled community management for our Product Development team. As the first ever Liaison in Engineering, I was greeted with..kind of a lot of work.</p>

				<p>The role was equal parts playing devil's advocate to Product, and acting as a conduit for issues the community had with our software development process (or vice versa). As with any job, there were both successes and failures, for a lot of reasons I'm happy to discuss but probably won't write out in the middle of my semi-formal C.V.</p>

				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>Despite being a HCI researcher, my background is actually law. I was awarded my law degree by the University of Northampton in 2011, following a double-length thesis focusing on the evolution of the Diceyan orthodoxy in the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty, and the historical and modern challenges to it. It's more interesting than it sounds, but not by much.

				<p>While at university I (amongst other things) occupied my time with acting as the Equality & Diversity officer for the Students' Union, and working as a political campaigner for the Liberal Democrats. The only real consequences of this is that I know far too much about charitable trusts law in England and Wales, and have a fun story involving a trust instrument, an NUS investigation and the democratic ideal.</p>

				<h4>Skillset</h4>
				<p>In terms of the code I write, I tend to depend on an R, SQL, Hive and Hadoop stack. Outside of that I'm comfortable mixing in bits of Python, AWK and C++ when necessary.</p>

				<p>I've used Git, Gerrit and Bugzilla extensively to handle code and its problems, along with Mingle and Trello to look at the (slightly) bigger picture. I'm familiar with both agile methodology and the idiosyncracies of trying to come up with researcher processes in an agile environment. I've been involved with FOSS and Open Culture projects since I was fifteen years old, and have a pretty good understanding of what to do (and not to do) around copyright law.</p>

				<h4>Contact</h4>
				<p>I can be found via (in order of preference) <a href="mailto:ironholds@gmail.com">email</a>, IRC as Ironholds on Freenode, <a href = "https://twitter.com/quominus">Twitter</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ironholds">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
